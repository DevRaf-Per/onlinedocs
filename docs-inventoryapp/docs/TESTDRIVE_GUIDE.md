## FAQ - Test Drives

**Q: What if the customer doesn't have insurance?**
A: Contact your manager before proceeding. Many organizations require proof of insurance for liability reasons. This may need to be documented or policy may restrict uninsured test drives.

**Q: Can I do a test drive with multiple customers?**
A: Enter the primary customer (driver) name and note the passenger count in the "Number of People" field.

**Q: What if the vehicle's barcode is damaged?**
A: Use the vehicle's VIN or alternate ID number. Manually enter it in the barcode field and note in comments that barcode was unreadable.

**Q: How long should a test drive be?**
A: This varies by organization. Check with your manager for typical durations and maximum time limits.

**Q: What if I forget to take photos?**
A: Try to get photos when the vehicle is returned. Pre-drive photos are preferred, but post-return documentation is better than none.

**Q: Can I edit a test drive after submission?**
A: No, submitted checkouts cannot be edited. Contact your administrator if you need to correct information.
