# InventoryApp

InventoryApp is a cross-platform mobile application used by field staff to manage inventory items.  The app runs on Android and iOS devices and provides features such as scanning item IDs, checking items in/out, capturing customer details for test drives, and optionally tracking trip data.

This repository contains the source code; the mobile builds are distributed through your organisation's chosen channel.  The documentation in this project is aimed at end users who need to understand how to use the application on their devices.

## User Documentation

Start here if you are using the app:

- **[End‑User Guide](docs/UserGuide.md)** – a comprehensive manual covering installation, permissions, everyday workflows, troubleshooting, and best practices.

The file `INVENTORYAPP_USER_GUIDE.md` at the root is a legacy copy that redirects to the current guide.

## Features
